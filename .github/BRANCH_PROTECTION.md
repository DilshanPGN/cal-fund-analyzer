# Branch Protection Configuration

This repository implements branch protection for the main branch through GitHub Actions workflows and CODEOWNERS file.

## Files Created for Branch Protection

### 1. `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Defines code ownership requiring @DilshanPGN approval for all changes
- Ensures all pull requests require review from the repository owner

### 2. `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`
- Prevents direct pushes to main branch
- Validates pull request workflow

### 3. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Comprehensive CI pipeline with branch protection enforcement
- Provides clear error messages when branch protection is violated

### 4. `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Guides contributors through the proper PR process
- Includes checklist for quality contributions

## Repository Settings Recommendations

To complete the branch protection setup, the following should be configured in GitHub repository settings:

1. **Branch Protection Rules for `main`:**
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators in restrictions
   - Restrict pushes that create merge commits

2. **Required Status Checks:**
   - `validate-pr` (from ci.yml workflow)
   - `branch-protection-check` (from branch-protection.yml workflow)

3. **Code Review Requirements:**
   - Require review from CODEOWNERS
   - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed

## How It Works

1. **Direct Push Protection**: The CI workflow detects direct pushes to main and fails with clear instructions
2. **PR Validation**: All pull requests are validated through automated checks
3. **Code Ownership**: CODEOWNERS file ensures @DilshanPGN must approve all changes
4. **Documentation**: Clear contribution guidelines in README.md and PR template

This setup ensures that all changes to the main branch go through a proper review process while maintaining code quality and security.
