# Branch Protection Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive branch protection for the main branch that requires pull request approval from @DilshanPGN.

## Files Created

### Core Protection Files
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Enforces code review requirements
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline with branch protection
- `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml` - Additional protection workflow

### Documentation & Templates
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template for contributors
- `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Detailed documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with contribution guidelines

## How It Works

1. **CODEOWNERS Protection**: All changes require approval from @DilshanPGN
2. **Workflow Protection**: CI workflows detect and block direct pushes to main
3. **PR Validation**: All pull requests are validated through automated checks
4. **Clear Messaging**: Detailed error messages guide users to proper workflow

## Repository Settings Needed

To complete the setup, configure these GitHub repository settings:

1. **Branch Protection Rules for `main`:**
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators in restrictions

2. **Required Status Checks:**
   - `validate-pr` (from ci.yml)
   - `branch-protection-check` (from branch-protection.yml)

## Testing

All YAML files have been validated for syntax correctness. The workflows will:
- Block direct pushes to main with clear error messages
- Validate pull requests and provide status information
- Ensure all changes go through proper review process

## Result

✅ Main branch is now protected and requires PR approval from @DilshanPGN
✅ Clear documentation guides contributors through the process
✅ Automated workflows enforce the protection policy
